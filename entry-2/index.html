<h1><i>Bellis perennis</i></h1>
  <h5>Article    Talk</h5>
<h5>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h5>
<p><i><b>Bellis perennis</i></B> (<span style="color: blue;"> /bɛləs pəˈrɛnəs/</span>),[2][3] the <b>daisy</b>, is a European species of the <span style="color: blue;">family Asteraceae</span>, often considered the archetypal species of the name daisy. To distinguish this <span style="color: blue;">species</span> from other plants known as daisies, it is sometimes qualified or known as <b>common daisy, lawn daisy</b> or <b>English daisy.</b></p>


<h2>Description <style="font-size: smaller;"> [edit] </h2>

<p><i>Bellis perennis</i> is a <span style="color: blue;">perennial herbaceous plant</span> growing to 20 centimetres (8 inches) in height.[4] It has short creeping <span style="color: blue;">rhizomes</span> and rosettes of small rounded or spoon-shaped leaves that are from 2 to 5 cm (3⁄4–2 in) long and grow flat to the ground. The species habitually colonises lawns, and is difficult to eradicate by mowing, hence the term 'lawn daisy'. It blooms from March to September[4] and exhibits the phenomenon of <span style="color: blue;">heliotropism</span>, in which the flowers follow the position of the sun in the sky.<br> <br>

The <span style="color: blue;">flowerheads</span> are composite, about 2 to 3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) in diameter, in the form of a <span style="color: blue;">pseudanthium</span>, consisting of many sessile flowers with white <span style="color: blue;">ray florets</span> (often tipped red) and yellow disc florets. Each <span style="color: blue;">inflorescence</span> is borne on a single leafless stem 2 to 10 cm (3⁄4–4 in), rarely 15 cm (6 in) tall. The <span style="color: blue;">capitulum</span>, or disc of florets, is surrounded by two rows of green <span style="color: blue;">bracts</span> known as "phyllaries".[5] The achenes are without pappus.[6]</p><br>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<i>Bellis</i> may come from <i>bellus</i>, Latin for "pretty", and perennis is Latin for "everlasting".[7]<br><br>

The name "daisy", possibly originating with this plant,[4] is considered a corruption of "day's eye",[8] because the whole head closes at night and opens in the morning. <span style="color: blue;">Geoffrey Chaucer</span> called it "eye of the day". In Medieval times, Bellis perennis or the English Daisy was commonly known as "Mary's Rose".[9]<br><br>

Historically, the plant has also been widely known as <b>bruisewort</b>, and occasionally <b>woundwort</b> (although this name is now more closely associated with the genus <span style="color: blue;">Stachys</span>). It is also known as bone flower.[10]
